I am a PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, and I am a member of the Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Science and the APRIL research lab. My research focuses on the use of neural networks as surrogates to solve inverse problems involving differential equations. I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href=https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~kzygalak/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Dr. Konstantinos C. Zygalakis</a>,  <a href=https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~ateckent/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Dra. Aretha Teckentrup</a> and  <a href=http://nolovedeeplearning.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Dr. Antonio Vergari</a>.
